# A LaTeX class for Nature preprints

Emulates the look of a *Nature* Letter. Pretty straightforward. See example.tex for implementation. 

## A note about Fonts

*Nature* print is typeset using the font *Minion Pro*. 
This font is [no longer supported](https://arxiv.org/help/faq/freefonts) by arXiv. 
The closest free and arXiv-supported font I could find (which should be availble by default with a typical LaTeX installation) 
is *Palatino*. This font - along with its Math equivalent - is niceley implemented with the `mathpazo` package.
